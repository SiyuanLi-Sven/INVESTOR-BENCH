2025-08-08T23:07:58.759289+0800 INFO AGENT-Short Memory: 15, The Visiongain report projects the global Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) drugs market to grow at a CAGR of 0.6% in the latter half of the forecast period, reaching $58 billion in 2018. The biologics submarket, which held 85% of the RA market in 2018, is a significant driver of this growth. Key players in the market include Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), which is well-positioned given its strong portfolio of RA drugs like Remicade and Simponi. The report provides detailed revenue forecasts by drug class, individual drugs, and regions, highlighting North America and Europe as leading markets. Investors should note the market's modest growth rate and the dominance of biologics, which could influence JNJ's strategic focus and investment in this sector. (Sentiment: neutral)
