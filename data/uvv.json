Operating income also rose to $8.5 million, driven by higher sales volumes, although segment operating income declined due to lower margins and delays in Brazil. Revenues increased by 6% to $315.8 million, but the mix of lower-margin carryover crops impacted profitability. The company is experiencing some volatility in foreign currency rates and anticipates that sales volumes will be weighted towards the latter half of the fiscal year. Management remains focused on safety, efficient operations, and exploring investments in both tobacco and non-tobacco businesses to deliver shareholder value. (Sentiment: positive)"
