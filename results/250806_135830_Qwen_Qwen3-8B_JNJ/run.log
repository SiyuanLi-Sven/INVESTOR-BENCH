The company is now offering this solution globally under an Enterprise Software-as-a-Service model, enabling manufacturers to gain visibility on their digital shelf presence. This technology is particularly relevant for major Consumer Healthcare and FMCG firms, including Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), which is one of the partners. The platform's rapid setup, driven by AI and machine learning, allows for quick adaptation to market demands, which have surged significantly for COVID-19 related products. This development could enhance JNJ's ability to manage product availability and pricing, potentially leading to improved market performance during the pandemic. (Sentiment: positive)", "The new research report by Safe Kids Worldwide, supported by Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc., reveals that over 47,000 children under age 6 are seen in emergency rooms annually for medicine poisoning, equating to five children every hour. The report highlights common misconceptions about medicine safety and provides actionable steps for parents to prevent such incidents, emphasizing the importance of storing medicine out of children's reach and using child-resistant packaging. This underscores the critical role of Johnson & Johnson's consumer health products in addressing child safety, potentially enhancing the company's brand reputation and consumer trust. The findings may drive increased demand for child-resistant packaging and safety-focused products, presenting a growth opportunity for Johnson & Johnson. Investors should consider the positive impact of these safety initiatives on J&J's market position and long-term profitability. (Sentiment: positive)", "Centinel Spine, LLC has appointed Steven F. Murray as CEO, effective March 16, 2020, succeeding John J. Viscogliosi. Murray, an industry veteran with over 25 years of experience in orthopedics and 20 years as an executive, was most recently President of Advanced Sterilization Products at Johnson & Johnson. Under Viscogliosi's leadership, Centinel Spine achieved record revenue in 2019 and established significant partnerships, including with Tiger Woods, to enhance public education on spinal disease. The company, known for its pioneering technology in anterior column reconstruction, recently acquired the prodisc Total Disc Replacement Technology Platform, solidifying its position as a leader in both cervical and lumbar motion-preserving and fusion solutions. This leadership change and strategic acquisitions indicate potential growth and innovation, making Centinel Spine a company to watch in the spine industry. (Sentiment: positive)", 'The global smoking cessation and nicotine de-addiction market is projected to grow by USD 16.6 billion from 2020 to 2024, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13%. Key growth drivers include an increasing number of people attempting to quit smoking and product innovations. The market is segmented by product types such as e-cigarettes, NRT, and drug therapy, and geographically across APAC, Europe, MEA, North America, and South America. Prominent vendors include Johnson & Johnson Services Inc. (JNJ), along with other major players like British American Tobacco Plc and GlaxoSmithKline Plc.
