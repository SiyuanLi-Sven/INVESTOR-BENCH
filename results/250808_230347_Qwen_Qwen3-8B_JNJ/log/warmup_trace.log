Wolk and VP of Investor Relations Christopher DelOrefice leading the call. The call will include a Q&A session with additional members of the executive team.

The global market for surgical robotic systems, including capital equipment, service, and training, was valued at $2.63 billion in 2019 and is projected to grow at an annual rate of 18.2% to reach $6.07 billion by 2024. Laparoscopic systems will remain the dominant segment due to their wide application, but bronchoscopic and cardiovascular robotic systems are expected to see the fastest growth. Johnson & Johnson, through its subsidiary Verb Surgical, is a key player in the laparoscopic robotic systems market, which is poised for significant expansion. The increasing global adoption of robotic surgery technologies is driven by the need for more predictable surgical outcomes, particularly in complex cases. This growth trend presents a substantial investment opportunity in the surgical robotics sector, particularly for companies like Johnson & Johnson that are well-positioned in this market. (Sentiment: positive)\n7. Convert Group, a Greek technology firm, has developed a solution to address the availability and price fluctuations of COVID-19 sensitive products in online pharmacies and groceries, which has been successfully implemented in Italy, Spain, and Greece. The company is now offering this solution globally under an Enterprise Software-as-a-Service model, enabling manufacturers to gain visibility on their digital shelf presence. This technology is particularly relevant for major Consumer Healthcare and FMCG firms, including Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), which is one of the partners. The platform\'s rapid setup, driven by AI and machine learning, allows for quick adaptation to market demands, which have surged significantly for COVID-19 related products. This development could enhance JNJ\'s ability to manage product availability and pricing, potentially leading to improved market performance during the pandemic. (Sentiment: positive)\n8. The new research report by Safe Kids Worldwide, supported by Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc., reveals that over 47,000 children under age 6 are seen in emergency rooms annually for medicine poisoning, equating to five children every hour. The report highlights common misconceptions about medicine safety and provides actionable steps for parents to prevent such incidents, emphasizing the importance of storing medicine out of children\'s reach and using child-resistant packaging. This underscores the critical role of Johnson & Johnson\'s consumer health products in addressing child safety, potentially enhancing the company\'s brand reputation and consumer trust. The findings may drive increased demand for child-resistant packaging and safety-focused products, presenting a growth opportunity for Johnson & Johnson. Investors should consider the positive impact of these safety initiatives on J&J\'s market position and long-term profitability. (Sentiment: positive)\n9. Centinel Spine, LLC has appointed Steven F.

(Sentiment: positive)In investment decision-making, analyzing financial sentiment is pivotal, offering insights into market perceptions and forecasting potential market trends. Sentiment analysis divides market opinions into three categories: positive, negative, and neutral. A positive sentiment signals optimism about future prospects, often leading to increased buying activity, while negative sentiment reflects pessimism,\n                        likely causing selling pressures. Neutral sentiment indicates either uncertainty or a balanced view, suggesting that investors are neither overly bullish nor bearish. Leveraging these sentiment indicators enables investors and analysts to fine-tune their strategies to better match the prevailing market atmosphere.\n                        Additionally, news about competitors can significantly impact a company\'s stock price. For example, if a competitor unveils a groundbreaking product, it may lead to a decline in the stock prices of other companies within the same industry as investors anticipate potential market share losses.\n                        \n\nThe mid-term information:\n-1.

2025-08-08T23:06:20.575801+0800 INFO AGENT-Short Memory: 17, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson have submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) to the U.S. FDA for ponesimod, an investigational treatment for adults with relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS). The NDA is supported by the Phase 3 OPTIMUM study, which demonstrated ponesimod's superior efficacy in reducing annualized relapse rate (ARR) and fatigue symptoms compared to Aubagio. The study also showed a significant reduction in combined unique active lesions (CUALs) in the brain. The safety profile of ponesimod was consistent with previous studies and other S1P receptor modulators. Investors should note the potential market impact given the high prevalence of MS and the unmet needs in its treatment. (Sentiment: positive)
